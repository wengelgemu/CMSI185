Welcome to EPICYON!

How to Play:

Run main.py This will start the game and load a board with both teams ships in oppossing corners!
Click the ships This will bring up the Statistics side bar, displaying important ship values! NOTE: As of this current demo, Buttons at the bottom do not work and can be ignored. Also, All ships have the same stats, that is not a bug. (This is to be changed later)
After clicking on one of your vessels, right-click a Space square. This will move your ship to that square. NOTE: As of this current demo, movement range has not been implemented. This means you can move anywhere on the board. On par with the honor system, please only right-click tiles directly next to you. Also, you cannot travel on asteroids. Be aware that your ship is not duplicating after having right-clicked, the tile has not refreshed yet and moving your mouse over it will fix it.
After moving within 2 tiles of an enemy, right click them to fire! This will spend some of your selected ships' ammo to do damage to the other ship selected. Be aware, friendly fire is active. NOTE: As of this current demo, there is no visual or audible feedback to firing. This means you could be firing without realizing it!
Defeat the enemy team in turn-based combat!
CONTROLS: This game is fully mouse operated so no keyboard input is necessary. WARNING!!! Testing with a trackpad has proven that tkinter software doesn't register certain trackpad "Right Mouse Button". Please play with a dedicated mouse to avoid proprietary software from your computer interfering with game inputs!
